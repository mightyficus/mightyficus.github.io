My homelab started out in the same way that a lot of people's homelabs do: Corporate greed.

Specifically, ads. I really hate ads, and I think a lot of people would agree with me. On my personal computers, dodging ads is really easy. Install Firefox, install uBlock Origin, boom. No ads. Toss in something to block cookies, and I'm golden. But you can't really do that on, say, a smart TV or a smartphone app. I found out that there's a pretty easy solution for that: a PiHole.
